<h1>Welcome to Intelligent Public Grievance Addressal System</h1>
<br>
<b><p>This project is used to record grievances form users and display it on a web app which is made using

python. It displays user grievances aesthetically using Google maps API . This web app has functionality 

of creating , reading, updating and deleting user issues,  comments. This app also filters grievances using 

the location of the user .Nearby users can view issues within a radius of 1km. The concept of building 

this web app is unique and has not been implemented on a metropolitan level by the government or any 

private enterprise. This gave us an opportunity to develop this web app and contribute to the city in a 

positive way.  This web app is aimed at spreading awareness among citizens armed with a smartphone 

and also demonstrates the power of citizens in a democratic society. This web app aims to improve 

productivity and coordination between different civic departments. These type of systems are present in 

first world countries like USA but are still not used in countries like India.</p>

Approach used for building the web app<br>

The programming language used in this project is Python using Flask, Jinja, Wzerg framework. The database is made using SQL

alchemy.HTML, CSS, JAVASCIPT,  JQuery  are used to build the frontend.  Python and SQL Alchemy were selected because of its robust functionality and simplified syntax.

The code is constructed by making functions for each and every operation performed in the web app and a template containing result is rendered in a template displayed in the front end.</p></b>
