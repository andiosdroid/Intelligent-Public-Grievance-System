# Intelligent-Public-Grievance-
The  project is a multi-platform application cloud application and uses  Flask faremwork.
This is a web app that allows users to post their complains along with their location and photo.
The project utilizes python scripts that calls the Google maps API to tag locations on the maps along with the users grievances.
This script then stores the data into a database using SQL database (SQl alchemy, and Post GRE SQL database).
The future vision is to shift this project to Hadoop for efficiency, optimization and scalability purposes.
The user can access the GUI using Chrome, Safari or any other supported HTML 5 supported browser.
The grievance would then be codified according to user location or pre-set constraints.
The aim of this project is to develop an end user review based informal complaining platform
